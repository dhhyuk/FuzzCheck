     A `InputPool` is a collection of test inputs along with some of their

     Each input in the `InputPool` is given a weight based on multiple factors
     (e.g. its features and its complexity). This weight determines the
     probability of being selected by the `randomIndex` method.
     
     The pool can also contain a “favored” input, which cannot be deleted and has
     a consistently high probability of being selected by `randomIndex`.
     
     Finally, the pool keeps track of the complexity of the simplest input that
     triggered each feature. It is used to filter out uninteresting inputs and
     to compute the score of each input.
     
     an inputPool can also have an alternate representation maintained by the
     Fuzzer’s world. For example, we could mirror the content of the pool in a
     folder in the file system. For that reason, some methods return a closure
     `(inout World) -> Void` that describes the action needed to maintain

        /*
         NOTE: the logic for computing the scores will probably change, but here
         is an explanation of the current behavior.
         
         The main ideas are:
         1. Each feature has a score that is split among all inputs containing
         that feature. Because simpler inputs are considered better, they receive a
         larger share of the feature score.
         2. an input's score is the sum of the scores associated with
         each of its features
         
         Example:
         The pool contains three inputs: u1, u2, u3, which have triggered these features:
         - u1: f1 f2 f3
         - u2:    f2 f3
         - u3:    f2    f4
         To keep it simple, let's assume that all features (f1, f2, f3. f4) have the same
         score of 1.
         Finally, we need to know the inputs' complexities:
         - u1: 10.0
         - u2: 5.0
         - u3: 5.0
         The final scores of the inputs will be:
         - u1: 1.31
         - u2: 1.24
         - u3: 1.44
         
         Let's first split the score of the feature f2 between u1, u2, and u3.
         
         (Notation: the share of an input `u`'s score given by a feature `fy`
         is written `u.fy_score`)
         
         We need to satisfy these conditions:
         1. u1.f2_score + u2.f2_score + u3.f2_score == f2.score (== 2)
         2. u1.f2_score < u3.f2_score (because u3 is a simpler, better input than u1)
         3. u2.f2_score == u3.f2_score (because u2 and u3 have the same complexity)
         4. u3.f2_score == u3.f2_score (obviously)
         
         There are many possible solutions to this system of equation, so we need to choose
         a specific ratio between u1.f1_score and u3.f1_score. I chose to use the squared ratio
         of the complexities of u1 and u3 (why? because I had to choose something and lack the
         empirical evidence needed to make an informed choice).
         So the equations are, more specifically:
         1. u1.f2_score + u2.f2_score + u3.f2_score == f2.score (== 1)
         2. u1.f2_score = (u3.complexity / u1.complexity)^2 * u3.f2_score
         3. u2.f2_score = (u3.complexity / u2.complexity)^2 * u3.f2_score
         4. u3.f2_score = (u3.complexity / u3.complexity)^2 * u3.f2_score
         
         We replace the terms in (1) with (2) and (3), abbreviating (u3.complexity / ux.complexity)^2 by ratio(ux)
         1. ratio(u1) * u3.f2_score + ratio(u2) * u3.f2_score + ratio(u3) * u3.f2_score = f2.score
        
         which can be simplified to:
         1. (ratio(u1) + ratio(u2) + ratio(u3)) * u3.f2_score = f2.score
         => u3.f2_score = f2.score / (ratio(u1) + ratio(u2) + ratio(u3))     [ref: #LHBasKGXc]
         which allows us to compute an unknown of the equation, finally!
         => u3.f2_score = 1.0 / (0.25 + 1.0 + 1.0) = 0.44

         the remaining scores can now be computed:
         2. u1.f2_score = ratio(u1) * u3.f2_score = (5.0 / 10.0)^2 * 0.44 = 0.11
         3. u2.f2_score = ratio(u2) * u3.f2_score = (5.0 / 5.0)^2 * 0.44 = 0.44
        
         It all checks out:
         1. u1.f2_score + u2.f2_score + u3.f2_score == 0.11 + 0.44 + 0.44 = 1.0 = f2.score
         
         Repeat this procedure with the other features to find the total score of each unit.
         
         So, in order to compute the score of each unit, we need to sum the complexity ratio between
         a particular unit and all other units (see: #LHBasKGXc). We decide that this “particular unit”
         is the simplest unit containing the feature (as we already keep track of its complexity in
         `smallestInputComplexityForFeature`).
         
         This is what the code below does!
         
         Except not really! There is an exception.
         
         If an input is not the simplest one to contain any particular feature, we delete it from
         the pool, to avoid pool bloat. Maybe in the future we should use inputs' scores to decide
         whether to delete them from the pool, but that would be more complicated.
